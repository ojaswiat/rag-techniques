"""Benchmark cell orchestrator (Architecture.md §4.5a).

One "cell" is a single (source_set, query_id, pipeline, k_value) run:
retrieve k nodes for the query from one pipeline, hand them to the shared
Answerer, and write one `results` row. The full benchmark is the cross
product of the query set, the three pipelines, and the three K values.

Resumability is row-level and rests on
`results.UNIQUE(source_set, query_id, pipeline, k_value)` (Architecture.md
§3.4): every run first reads back the keys already committed and skips
them, so a crash or an interrupted overnight batch never re-spends
free-tier quota on a cell that is already recorded.

Retrievers are injected rather than imported here. P1/P2/P3 own very
different heavyweight setup (a Chroma collection plus a cross-encoder, a
pickled BM25 corpus, a cached summary tree), and constructing all three
eagerly would make a single-pipeline run pay for all of them -- so the
caller decides which pipelines are in play.

The Judge's columns (precision_at_k, recall_at_k, evidence_hit,
citation_match, token_f1, exact_match, judge_score, human_score) are left
NULL here. This phase produces the raw outputs; Phase 6 scores them.
