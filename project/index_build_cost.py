"""Index build cost: the third leg of the efficiency pillar.

Latency and tokens describe what a query costs once the index exists.
They say nothing about what it cost to create that index, which is a
one-off per corpus but is the dominant difference between these three
pipelines: two build locally with no LLM, one drives an LLM over every
node in the filing.

The two halves of this module reflect how the two kinds of cost become
knowable. P3's cost can only be captured while the build runs, because
its wall clock includes provider queueing that cannot be replayed, so
`build_summary_index` writes an append-only attempt log and this module
reads it back. P1 and P2 are local, deterministic and cheap enough to
re-run, so their cost is measured on demand by rebuilding into a scratch
directory and timing it.

Both halves land in one committed snapshot, because the P3 log lives
under the git-ignored `logs/` tree and would otherwise leave the
efficiency pillar unreproducible from a fresh clone.

Wall clock is reported as measured, including the time P3 spent waiting
on its provider. That wait is a real cost of the design, not measurement
noise, and removing it would report a build that nobody can actually
run.

    A filing can appear several times: a genuine rebuild, or a resumed run

    the last one that actually called the model, because that is the build
    that produced the tree on disk and the tree the benchmark queried. Every
    other attempt is reported separately rather than dropped, since the time
    was really spent, but it is not the cost of building the corpus once.

    Taking the plain last attempt instead would be wrong in a way that is easy
    to miss: a resumed run re-walks persisted work without calling the model,
    so it records real wall clock against zero tokens, and summing those would
    report most of the corpus as having cost nothing to summarise.

    Token counts are summed only over the attempts that actually recorded
    them. Two filings were built before the build logged its token counts, so
    their tokens are absent rather than zero; they are named in the result so
    the total can be reported as a floor over the filings that have one,
    instead of quietly counting a missing measurement as free.
