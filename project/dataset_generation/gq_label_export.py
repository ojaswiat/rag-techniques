"""Writes golden_queries_to_label.md so a researcher can hand-write the
'why this answer is good' note and 0-100 score for each of the 20 golden
queries.

write_gq_labels.py is the authority for the current calibration set. The
markdown template this module writes has no example_output field, so
re-importing a stale golden_queries_to_label.md would overwrite
human_score, human_reasoning and is_good with old values while leaving
example_output exactly as write_gq_labels.py left it, silently mismatching
the two halves of the calibration."""
