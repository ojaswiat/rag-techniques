"""Phase 6 validation-gate orchestrator (Architecture.md §4.5b).

Runs the 20 JEQ questions through P1/P2/P3 at a single K=5 -- 60 outputs with
source_set='JEQ' -- by reusing loop_executor (retrieval + shared Answerer),
then runs the Judge over those 60 rows. It adds no retrieval, answering, or
scoring logic of its own; both callees already carry the mandatory
LOCAL_TEST_THROTTLE (Guardrails §7), so a throttled dry run of this gate caps
at THROTTLE_LIMIT rows through each stage without any extra brake here.

Human scoring and the Agreement-Rate gate itself live in
score_gate_outputs.py -- this module only produces the machine side (pipeline
outputs, deterministic metrics, judge_score) those steps compare against.
