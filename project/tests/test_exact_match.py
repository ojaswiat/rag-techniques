"""exact_match: Q1/Q3-only, extraction/containment semantics.

Resolves the Architecture.md §4.3-vs-§3.3 tension in favour of the worked
§3.3 row (recorded in deviations.md #26): a figure or short answer counts as
an exact match when it can be *found* inside the model's sentence, not only
when the whole sentence equals the ground truth. EM is undefined (None) for
the implicit quadrants Q2/Q4, per Project_Idea.md §7.
