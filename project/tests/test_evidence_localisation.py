"""evidence_localisation: reducing gt_citations to the minimal evidence set.

The rule must shrink an over-broad answer key without ever inventing evidence,
and must refuse rather than guess when it cannot show that a node yields the
answer. The safety properties (never introduces an uncited node, never empties
a row, never writes an unverified repair) matter more than the shrinking, so
they are asserted directly rather than inferred from a happy-path result.
