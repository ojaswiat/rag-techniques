"""Where each pipeline looked, measured against where the evidence actually was.

The aggregate metrics say how often a pipeline found the supporting node. They
do not say how it failed, and for the structural pipeline that distinction
carries the whole argument: a retriever that returns valid but consistently
misplaced nodes is behaving as designed and badly suited to the task, whereas
one that returns the same few nodes for every question is simply broken.

Two measurements separate those cases.

Diversity is distinct node ids over total returned slots across the benchmark.
A pipeline that ignores the query converges on the same handful of nodes and
scores low; one that responds to the query scores high. It is measured corpus
wide rather than within a single result row, because no pipeline returns the
same node twice in one row and a within-row figure is therefore always 1.000
and says nothing.

Miss distance is the number of nodes between a returned node and the nearest
node of ground-truth evidence. Because the filings run from under 700 nodes to
over 3,600, it is also reported as a share of the filing it was measured in;
an absolute distance averaged across the corpus is dominated by the longest
documents and is not comparable between them.

Node position comes from the node id. `ingest/node_builder.build_nodes` walks
the parsed filing top to bottom and stamps an incrementing counter into each
id, so the integer in `AAPL_2023_n0412` is that node's position in the
document. This is the only ordering the database carries, since
`nodes.source_page_num` was never populated.
