"""Reference scores for the validation gate, written without the Judge's.

On this run the agent supplies the reference score in place of a human, so
the figure the gate computes is cross-model concordance rather than an
external human-agreement rate. Independence is the one property it still
carries, and this module enforces two things structurally rather than by
the scorer's discipline:

* Evidence parity -- the rendered fields (quadrant, query_text,
  ground_truth_answer, pipeline_output) are exactly what
  async_judge._build_target_message() sends the Judge, plus quadrant, which
  the Judge effectively also sees through its quadrant-matched calibration
  exemplars. gt_citations and cited_node_ids are withheld because
  Guardrails Sec 4b forbids the Judge from grading citations; showing them
  to the scorer but not the Judge would make any disagreement partly
  measure that evidence gap rather than the Judge's quality.
* Pipeline blindness -- result_id encodes the pipeline
  (f"R_{source_set}_{query_id}_{pipeline}_K{k_value}"), and the pipeline
  column names it directly, so both are dropped from the rendering and
  replaced with an opaque token ("row_0000", ...). A scorer who can tell an
  answer came from P3 -- the pipeline this dissertation predicts will
  perform worst -- could shade the score toward the expected result,
  contaminating both the gate and the headline pipeline comparison the
  project exists to produce. apply_scores() re-derives the same token
  order to translate a token-keyed score mapping back to result_id, so the
  real identifier never has to leave this module.

  A token's *position*, not just its text, can leak the pipeline:
  get_jeq_judging_rows() orders by result_id, and result_id sorts
  alphabetically by pipeline name within each query, so assigning tokens
  in that natural order reproduces a perfect repeating cycle (every third
  row is the same pipeline). Rows are shuffled with a fixed seed before
  tokens are assigned, so the token order carries no pipeline signal while
  still being exactly reproducible between a render call and the apply
  call that follows it.
