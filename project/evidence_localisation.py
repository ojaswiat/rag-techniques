"""Reduces gt_citations to the minimal set of nodes that supports the answer.

The Generator is told to draw gt_citations from the section it was shown but
is never told to make that list minimal, so on some rows it returns the whole
section. That is not a harder question, it is a wrong answer key: recall_at_k
divides by len(gt) with no cap, so a gold set larger than the largest k makes
full recall arithmetically unreachable, while precision_at_k divides by k and
is inflated by the same bloat.

The rule here only ever retains a subset of the citations a row already has;
it never introduces a node the Generator did not cite, and never consults a
pipeline's output, so it cannot be tuned toward a result. A node is retained
only when it demonstrably yields the answer, either by containing it (the
direct quadrants) or by reproducing it arithmetically (the implicit
quadrants, where the answer is computed and appears in no node verbatim).
Every retained node carries a recorded reason. A row where nothing can be
verified is left exactly as it was and reported, rather than guessed at.
